# Homework 1 - ADM Course

This repository contains the submission for the [first homework](http://aris.me/contents/teaching/data-mining-ds-2024/homeworks/homework1.pdf) of the [ADM course](http://aris.me/contents/teaching/data-mining-ds-2024/homeworks/homework1.pdf). The homework consists of tasks completed on HackerRank. 

## Files

- **scripts.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the solutions to the HackerRank tasks.
- **stamps.pdf**: PDF file showing screenshots of the submission pages from HackerRank.

## Notebook structure

The **scripts.ipynb** notebook contains all the tasks from the two exercises assigned in this homework, more or less in the prescribed order. 
Please note that the code was reported as it was written in HackerRank, so some of the cells may not be immediately runnable without adjustments.

## How to Use

You can view the notebook by opening `scripts.ipynb` in any Jupyter notebook environment or through GitHub's integrated notebook viewer.

### Downloading Submissions from HackerRank

The solutions were downloaded from HackerRank using a modified script from [vokbuda](https://github.com/vokbuda). Originally, the script only output `.py` files, but it was modified to also support `.ipynb` file generation. 

If you want to use the script for your own submissions, you can find the original script [here](https://github.com/vokbuda/submissions_hackerrank) and the modified version [here](https://github.com/cycileo/submissions_hackerrank).
